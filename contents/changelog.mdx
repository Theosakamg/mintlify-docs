### Monitor your HTTP traffic

Gain visibility into your monthly consumption. Monitor your usage and set custom email alerts to avoid overages.

#### Gain visibility into your project's HTTP traffic and set customizable usage alerts

To help you better control your costs and avoid surprises on your invoice, we're introducing a new way to monitor your project's HTTP traffic. The new "Traffic this month" block on your project overview provides at-a-glance visibility into your monthly usage for origin and CDN bandwidth and requests.

To be even more proactive, you can now set custom thresholds and receive email notifications when your usage is exceeded. When a configured threshold is crossed, an email is sent to your organization's owner, members with the `billing` role, and the billing contact.

Get started by visiting your project's overview page in the Console. For automation, this functionality is also fully supported via our API.

### Introducing Guaranteed CPU

Scale to new heights. Get consistent performance and larger resources with Guaranteed CPU.

#### Unlock power and predictability for your critical workloads with Guaranteed CPU

For applications that require the highest level of performance and large resources, we are excited to introduce Guaranteed CPU. This new feature gives you access to powerful, isolated resources directly on the Grid.

By allocating Guaranteed CPU to your most critical containers, you can ensure stable, predictable performance for demanding workloads. It also unlocks the ability to scale your applications like never before, with resource sizes available all the way up to 64 CPUs. The entire process is fully self-service from the Console or CLI, giving you the power to scale on your own terms.

Guaranteed CPU is now available for all projects on Upsun Flex running in our AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure regions.
