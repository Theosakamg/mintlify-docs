# test

<ProviderName /> includes many services, so you don't have to subscribe to external cache or search engine services.
Because the services are included in your project, you can manage them through Git
and they're backed up together with the rest of your project.

Your project defines the services configuration from a top-level key called `services`, which is placed in a unified configuration file like <code>{config.configFiles.services}</code>.
If you don't need any services (such as for a static website), you don't need to include this configuration. Read on to see how to add services.
